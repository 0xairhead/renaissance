# Module 03: Modern Existentialism

In the 19th and 20th centuries, traditional religion faded in the West. Philosophers asked: "If there is no God/Destiny, what is the point?"

## 1. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900)
**The Dynamite.** He saw that science had killed religious belief ("God is Dead") and warned that nihilism (believing in nothing) would destroy us unless we created our own values.

*   **Master vs. Slave Morality**: He criticized Christian morality as "weak" because it glorified suffering and humility. He wanted a morality of strength and life-affirmation.
*   **The Ubermensch (Overman)**: The ideal individual who creates their own values and meaning, rising above the herd.
*   **Amor Fati**: "Love your fate." Don't just bear your life; celebrate it, even the pain.
*   **Key Takeaway**: Create your own meaning. Say "YES" to life.

## 2. Albert Camus (1913–1960)
**The Rebel.** He addressed the tension between our desire for meaning and the universe's silence.

*   **The Absurd**: We crave logic and justice; the universe gives us neither. That conflict is "The Absurd."
*   **The Myth of Sisyphus**: Sisyphus is condemned to roll a rock up a hill forever, only to watch it roll back down. Is this tragic? No.
*   **"One must imagine Sisyphus happy."**: The struggle itself is enough to fill a man's heart. We find dignity in pushing the rock, even if it's pointless.
*   **Key Takeaway**: Life has no inherent meaning, and that's okay. Live with passion anyway.

## 3. Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980)
**The Architect of Freedom.**

*   **"Existence precedes Essence"**: A knife is designed to cut (essence) before it is made (existence). Humans are made (existence) first, and we have no design. We define our own essence through choices.
*   **Radical Freedom**: You are completely free. You cannot blame your parents, society, or your genes.
*   **Bad Faith**: Lying to yourself that you "had no choice." You always have a choice, even if the choice is just how to react to imprisonment.
*   **Key Takeaway**: You are what you do. Take full responsibility for your life.
