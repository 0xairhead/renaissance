# Module 04: Applied Philosophy

Philosophy isn't just theory; it's an operating system for daily life.

## 1. Stoicism (The Ultimate OS for Stability)
Born in Greece, perfected in Rome. The favorite philosophy of emperors, slaves, and modern CEOs.

### The Dichotomy of Control
**Epictetus** said: *“Some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us.”*
*   **Up to us**: Our opinions, our impulses, our reactions.
*   **Not up to us**: The weather, traffic, what other people think of us, the economy.
*   **The Rule**: Focus 100% of your energy on what is up to you. Ignore the rest.

### Marcus Aurelius
The Roman Emperor who wrote *Meditations* (a diary to himself) while fighting a war.
*   **On Anxiety**: "Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside."
*   **Memento Mori**: "Remember you will die." Use this not to be sad, but to stop wasting time on petty things.

## 2. Mental Models (Tools for Thinking)

### First Principles Thinking
Break a problem down to its basic truths (physics/facts) and build up from there. Don't just do what everyone else does (analogy).
*   *Example*: Elon Musk didn't ask "How much does a rocket help cost?"; he asked "What is a rocket made of? Aluminum, titanium, fuel. What is the spot price of those materials?"

### Occam's Razor
When presented with competing explanations, the one that requires the fewest assumptions is usually correct.
*   *Application*: If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras (unless you are in the Serengeti).

### Hanlon's Razor
"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
*   *Application*: The person who cut you off in traffic probably isn't evil; they are probably just distracted or a bad driver. Don't take it personally.
